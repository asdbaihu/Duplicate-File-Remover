A command line utility that {\bfseries recursively} scans the set directory to find exact duplicate files inside all the sub-\/directories. The files so found can be listed in an output file. If required the duplicates can also be removed, thereby preserving a single unique file.

{\bfseries Features\+:}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Recursive scan of the set directory.
\item Generate list of duplicate files.
\item Scan all files or filter based on file extension.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

{\bfseries Future Plans\+:}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Set a recursive scan depth for the set directory.
\item A way to exclude certain directories.
\item A way to include only some directories.
\item Robust error handling for synchronization issues.
\item Make the program interactive.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\begin{quote}
Caution\+: As of now, there is no way to select which of the duplicate files will be preserved. The selection happens on the order in which they are loaded into {\ttfamily std\+::map}. The first file is the one which is preserved. \end{quote}


\subsection*{Downloading and Building}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone the project\+:

{\ttfamily git clone \href{https://github.com/vishal-wadhwa/Duplicate-File-Remover.git}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/vishal-\/wadhwa/\+Duplicate-\/\+File-\/\+Remover.\+git}}
\item Change directory to src\+:

{\ttfamily cd src}
\item Build project using Make utility\+:

{\ttfamily make main}
\item Run it (See \href{#use}{\tt Usage})\+:

{\ttfamily ./main ...}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Testing}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item From the root directory of the project go to test directory\+:

{\ttfamily cd test}
\item Build tests using Make utility.

{\ttfamily make test}
\item Run them tests, bruh\+:

{\ttfamily ./test}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

You should see {\itshape OK} if all the tests pass and then you can go on to using the program.;)
